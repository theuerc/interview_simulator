This is good advice for the introduction of an interview:

Have a strong start to any interview (at any stage) by highlighting your achievements and telling a comprehensive story (quickly).


"Tell me about yourself" is one of the most frequently asked questions during interviews, and generally is the first question asked. Your response should highlight your education/technical/ business related achievements. 
It is expected (and reasonable) to hint at previous application materials like a resume or cover letter. However, responses should be tailored to highlight how you will meet the needs of the organization.  Each interview will be slightly different.
Think about this answer as a longer version of an elevator pitch and a preview to the rest of the interview. 
What key takeaways are you communicating about your ability and interest in the role?
